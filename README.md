# Digit-Recognizer-ML-NaiveBayes


**Data Source**: The data set comes from the **Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition**. 

**Goal**: The goal is to recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwritten images. Because the original data set is too large, I have systematically sampled 5% each of the original training and testing data, stored in files called digit-train.csv and digit-test.csv, respectively.
You are going to use the training data to construct prediction models using both Na√Øve Bayes and decision tree algorithms. Tune their parameters to get the best model (measured by cross-validation) and compare which algorithms provide better performance on the testing data.
